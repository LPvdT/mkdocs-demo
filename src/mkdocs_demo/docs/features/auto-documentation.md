# Auto-generated Documentation

Documentation of this project's Python source code is automatically generated from each docstring in the Python code.

This result is compiled using the
[`mkdocstrings`](https://mkdocstrings.github.io/) package, and subsequently inserted into the main site.

The [`gen_ref_pages`][mkdocs_demo.lib.mkdocstrings.gen_ref_pages] function takes care of generating the documentation pages and their navigation structure for the site, using the [mkdocs-gen-files](https://github.com/oprypin/mkdocs-gen-files) plugin.
