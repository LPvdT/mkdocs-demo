# To do

+ [ ] Structure code:
  + Do not only use `lib/`
  + Add some more code to generate documentation from
+ [ ] Do some [site configuration](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/creating-your-site/)
+ [ ] CI/CD with `GitHub Actions`
+ [ ] Eventually use `Makefile` instead of `Poetry` jankyscripts

# Done

+ [x] [Basic mkdocs Material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/creating-your-site/#minimal-configuration-visual-studio-code)
+ [x] [mkdocstrings](https://github.com/mkdocstrings/mkdocstrings/tree/main)
+ [x] Refactor lib scripts to make use of a factory (e.g. pass command and create new func)
+ [x] Pre-commit hooks
